# Milestone 3: High-Fidelity Vertical Prototype

You will implement a working, high-fidelity vertical prototype that allows people to do all the tasks outlined in the beginning of Milestone 2, Part D. This builds from your paper prototype in Milestone 2, but your prototype won’t necessarily exactly match the paper one – it should evolve based on feedback. Note that major deviations from your previous prototype need to be explained and justified (see below).

You will use client-side web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, etc.). You are free to use additional libraries as long as they are documented and cited. However, be warned: platforms and libraries often enforce a look, feel, and flow: don’t let it constrain you. In other words, focus on your design first, and then select technologies that will enable you to achieve it. “I couldn’t do that using library X” is not a good justification for having a limited prototype (in terms of either novelty or usefulness).

**Note:** This is a hard assignment, and requires a great deal of initiative and self-learning. Please check and review the online materials we gave you, and get started early. Use the forums to ask technical questions, and ask for code help, as other students are likely facing similar issues.

**Technical requirements:**

- Your project must work on the most recent Chrome browser (Windows) without any web server     or additional technology required, as this is how the marker will evaluate it. You can assume that the marker will be online, so you can reference on-line libraries and resources.

- Your project should use dynamic web technologies (i.e., through JavaScript) to make changes  live without having to load a new page.

- Hard-code and fake any real data (e.g., menu items). **Effort put into back-end software**     **engineering, databases, etc., will not translate into marks.** (hmm.. why?)

- Your marker will not read an HTML file or debug your code. Make sure that you code the solution with relative path names (to work on any machine, in any folder), and there is a clear index.html file that the marker will run to get started. Be safe: test on a range of machines before submission.

- It’s OK if your program needs a browser flag to run correctly (e.g., to bypass some security features     since you’re not using a server). Include a README file that explains how to run your program. **Usability requirements:**

- Try to apply all the knowledge learned so far in class. Keep good records as you will report on this.

- Pay special attention to input and error checking. If the person does something unreasonable (like     enter a word for a tip), the system should act appropriately.

- Marks will be given for radical innovations and trying something new, assuming it is grounded in     good usability principles.

**Deliverable** : a single .zip file containing your stand-alone website that the marker can launch. Test this on a different machine before submitting!!

**Deliverable** : a writeup with the following sections

- _Technology overview._ What did you use, what was your approach, what libraries did you use?     Maximum half page.

- _Design deviations and evolutions._ Explain what changed from your paper prototype, and explain     why you made the change. For example, relate your changes to your user feedback. Technical     difficulty can sometimes be a reasonable justification for a change if what you had originally     envisioned turn out to be really difficult to implement. Maximum half page.

- _Usability “sales pitch”._ Use maximum 2 pages, perhaps in list form, to explain what usability     guidelines you employed – pictures and references to the prototype can help with clarity.

## Implementations  
**Farhan:**  

* Using React to make the webapp  
* imported icons from material_io   
* Implemented a sidebar with custom styling
